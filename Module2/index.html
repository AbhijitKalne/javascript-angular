            <p class="div-text">Fruits are the means by which flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) disseminate
                their seeds.In common language usage, "fruit" normally means the fleshy seed-associated structures
                of plants that typically are sweet or sour and edible in the raw state, such as apples,
                bananas, grapes.</p>

            <p class="div-text">Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food. The
                original meaning
                is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter,
                including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds.</p>

            </p>
            <p class="div-text">Proteins are essential nutrients for the human body. They are one of the building blocks
                of body tissue
                and can also serve as a fuel source. As a fuel, proteins provide as much energy density as
                carbohydrates: 4 kcal per gram; in contrast, lipids provide 9 kcal per gram.</p>
